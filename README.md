We had a Challenge in the Course Careers Discord to build a Mortgage Calculator

I used HTML and CSS to build a simple Interface with appealing colors

I used Bootstrap for button styling

Then I made a javascript file in order to listen for html form submission, and then perform a calculation to display back to the user appropriate monthly mortgage payments
